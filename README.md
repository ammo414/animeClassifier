uses a logistic classifier to determine if a given anime is going to be a good fit, given a anilist profile. This showcases data gathering, model development, and model deployment.

TODO:
Better document the model development process
Implement SQL database instead of using .CSVs
Implement a way to continously improve the model -- introduce continous injestion of new ratings (once a quarter?) and retrain the model with that new data.
